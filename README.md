This project was developed during the first block of the Generation bootcamp. In this phase, I was introduced to the Object-Oriented Paradigm, and for the first time, I was able to put CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) into practice

    class BankAccount {
        - accountNumber: int
        - balance: double
        + BankAccount(accountNumber: int)
        + deposit(amount: double): void
        + withdraw(amount: double): boolean
        + getBalance(): double
    }
